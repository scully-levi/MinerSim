# Miner Sim: A Froth Flotation Education Experience
CS 426 Senior Project in Computer Science  
Spring 2023, at UNR, CSE Department  
Team 11 - Nathan Bertram, Dustin Hurtz, Charlotte Moreland, Levi Scully  
Instructors - Dr. David Feil-Seifer and Devrin Lee  
Advisors - Dr. Sergiu Dascalu and Dr. Pengbo Chu  

## Project Description
MinerSim will be the prototype for an immersive virtual reality educational experience aimed to teach the scientific principles behind the froth flotation mineral separation process to mining engineering students in colleges and mining professionals in industry and, bring interest to mining engineering to highschool students around the Reno region.  
  
Separation of minerals by selective adhesion has been used almost as long as humans have pulled ore from the ground, with archaeological evidence showing the technique used in the Laurion silver mines in Greece. The separation process exploits the natural and inducible properties of mineral interaction with water, that is whether the mineral is hydrophilic or hydrophobic to separate hundreds of tons of minerals per day.  
  
MinerSim will include a virtual reality environment where users can look at the minerals, chemical and physical interactions of the frothing tank, bring up molecule representations of chemicals and various minerals will allow users to witness how the frothing process is able to separate minerals. With our cooperation between departments we will be able to refine this project to be a dynamic learning experience and a powerful tool for teaching complex topics. Itsâ€™ main functionalities will be an active simulation of a froth flotation tank with the ability to highlight the interactions between
chemicals and minerals with users able to explore the tank environment. User interactions and tracking data will be saved to a database for instructors to examine and tune lessons for individual students.  
  
MinerSim will be built for the meta quest pro, an all in one VR headset using the Unity Game Engine. Packages will include meta quest integration, Ultimate XR, SQL, and various assets from the Unity Asset store. MinerSim should be fairly reliable, since portability is a large concern, we are focusing on keeping a smooth performance on the headset. However the largest consequence of MinerSim crashing is that someone may have to restart their session. Ideally it will be reliable enough to take much of the instructor's time troubleshooting. Security is mostly a concern when focused on the user data collection and database access. If we have them access a web server for the information then we will need to implement a secure login feature. If canvas integration is possible then we may be able to utilize the built in security of canvas.
